New York City, as one of the most populated cities in the United States, has millions of cabs journeys every month. The goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of the trip record data and make some ideas that might help taxi drivers earn more money.By studying user trends, an organization's profit may be increased in a variety of ways. As a result, we'll need certain approaches to evaluate user activity and develop patterns as a result.
